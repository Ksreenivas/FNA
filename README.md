   
Welcome to your Rails app 

Check out the following guide points to get started with your Rails application:

1) To run your application, type the following in the terminal:

  $ rails server

2) To use MySQL instead of sqlite for persistence, http://technologyamateurs.blogspot.in/2014/04/how-do-i-switch-sqlite3-to-mysql-on-ror.html

3) If you want, pick the older Ruby version 1.8.7 using the 'rvm' command in the terminal.

4) If you want, pick the rails version you like installing it through the terminal:

  $ gem install rails --version 4.0.0

Happy coding!
